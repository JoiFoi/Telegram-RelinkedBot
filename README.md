🔑 Using bit.ly Link Shortener Development API

🐍 Written By Python!

🖥 We're using [python-telegram-bot Package](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/README.rst) to use Telegram-API in python.
And also [pyshorteners](https://pyshorteners.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to shorten our links.
Remember to place your own 'Telegram-API-Token' And 'Bitly-API-Token'
📖 We recommend saving your API-KEYs in a safe *.env* environment. Also, keep in mind that along with main.py file, there's a *.csv* file. The idea is to save some data from users while they shorten their links; Just for statistics and further usage that suits your needs! (Data inclued user_id , shortened link and time of shortening)
